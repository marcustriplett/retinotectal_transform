# retinotectal_transform

Simulates the transformation of a retinal representation of the direction of object motion to a tectal representation with a simple rate-based neural network.

See the corresponding journal article: "A three-layer network model of direction-selective circuits in the optic tectum. " F. Abbas et al. (2017). Frontiers in Neural Circuits.

Requires the export_fig, CircStat, and CBrewer packages.
